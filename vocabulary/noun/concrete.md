如：holiday, school, doctor, lock这四个 词，分别属于时间类、地点类、职业类、装置类，所以它们就可以分别 用这四个词来解释：  
* holiday：a period of time when you are not at work or school
* school：a place where children go to learn
* doctor：a person whose job is to make ill people well again
* lock：a device that keeps a door, gate closed that you can not open it without a key

## 一个顶1万的词
thing 这个词可以用来代替所有具体名词的类别。可用来指物，也可以用来指人。如

Put your things(指 cloth) on and let's go.  
You are quite a clever little thing(指 guy)!  

有时会用 something 来代替 thing。
